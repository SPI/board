IRC meetings
------------

The SPI Board meets on IRC once per month to conduct board meetings.

During board meetings, votes are cast to approve past minutes and to
vote on resolutions.  An irssi helper script can be used to conduct
the votes.

Load the script:

    /load ~/.irssi/vote.pl

Start a vote:

    /vote_start Meeting minutes for Thursday XX XXXXXXXX 2015:bdale,ganneff,tbm,schultmc,solver,linuxhiker,glp,zobel,xnox

Board members can now vote:

    !vote yes
    !vote no
    !vote abstain

When everyone has voted, stop the vote:

    /vote_stop

The results of the vote will be shown.
