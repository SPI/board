SPI maintains trademarks for several associated projects.


US trademarks
-------------

US trademarks have to be renewed on a regular basis:

* File a Declaration of Use (or Excusable Nonuse) between the 5th and 6th years after registration
* File a Declaration of Use (or Excusable Nonuse) between the 9th and 10th years after registration
* File a Declaration of Use (or Excusable Nonuse) and an Application for Renewal between every 9th and 10th-year period calculated from the registration date

The script check-us-trademark-filing-dates can be used as a reminder of
filing periods.  By default, it will only show upcoming filing deadlines.
With the --historical option, it will also show past filings.  The script
relies on a YAML file about the trademarks (us-trademarks.yaml), which
has to be updated manually.
