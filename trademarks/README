Trademarks
==========

SPI maintains trademarks for several associated projects.


US trademarks
-------------

US trademarks have to be renewed on a regular basis:

* File a Declaration of Use (or Excusable Nonuse) between the 5th and 6th years after registration
* File a Declaration of Use (or Excusable Nonuse) between the 9th and 10th years after registration
* File a Declaration of Use (or Excusable Nonuse) and an Application for Renewal between every 9th and 10th-year period calculated from the registration date

The script `check-us-trademark-filing-dates` can be used as a reminder of
filing periods.  By default, it will only show upcoming filing deadlines.
With the `--historical` option, it will also show past filings.  The script
relies on a YAML file about the trademarks (`us-trademarks.yaml`), which
has to be updated manually.

WIPO
----

* "the international registration is valid for ten years and can be renewed every ten years directly with WIPO" (Source: <https://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/how_to/manage/renewal.html>).
* "You may renew your international registration either before the 10-year term of protection expires or within the six-month grace period following its expiry" (with a 50% surcharge)
* "online requests for renewal will be available three months prior to the expiry of your international trademark registration" (Source: <https://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/news/2017/news_0014.html>).
